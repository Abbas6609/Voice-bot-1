Excited to share something cool I've been working on: a voice-activated AI chatbot, powered by Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo! This app lets you talk to AI just like you would with a friend, thanks to some neat tech under the hood.
🎙️ What’s Special About This VoiceBot?
Voice Recognition: Picks up your voice commands and gets what you're saying.
AI Chat: Chats back with responses that make sense based on the conversation.
Speak Back: Turns the AI’s text responses into speech, so it really feels like you’re having a chat.
Real-Time Chats: Designed for instant back-and-forth conversations with AI.
🛠️ Built With:
Streamlit: For the slick web app interface.
LangChain: Manages the AI chat logic.
Python libraries: For recognizing speech and converting text to speech.
This project is a fun peek into what’s possible when you blend AI with everyday interactions. It’s about making technology that’s not just smart, but also accessible and interactive.
